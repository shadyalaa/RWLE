//Evolves towards the "new real" average value, giving us time to notice that there is a change that is happening
//As an alternative, when we see that there is an anomaly, we could FIX the mean value AM against which we noticed the anomaly
//If we have that the (moving) average is considered X times consecutively as anomalous with respect to the FIXED AM
//Then we might trigger the change in workload
